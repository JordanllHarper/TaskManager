# TaskManager

A small CLI task manager application in progress

Progress:
- Viewing, adding, editing and deleting tasks
- CLI - want to migrate to GUI when learned
- Saving in runtime - wish to save outside of runtime in the future
- Couple of design patterns used - builder for task + project creation + factory for project + task creation
- Task properties implemented - name, due date, priority level, project association, do by date
- Project properties implemented - name
