# TaskManager

A small CLI task manager application in progress

Progress:
- Viewing, adding and deleting tasks
- CLI - want to migrate to GUI when learned
- Saving in runtime - wish to save outside of runtime in the future
- Couple of design patterns used - builder for task creation + factory for project creation
- Task properties implemented - name, due date, priority level, project association - plan is to include a "do by" date for when the users wishes to do the task, separate of due by (thanks things 3)
- Project properties implemented - name
